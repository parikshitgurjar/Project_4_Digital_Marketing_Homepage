### The things which i learn by doing this Project.

> <b>The Display property in CSS</b> defines how the components(div, hyperlink, heading, etc) are going to be placed on the web page. As the name suggests, this property is used to define the display of the different parts of a web page. 

Few important values are described below:

1. <b>Block:</b> <br/>
   - This property is used as the default property of div. This property places the div one after another vertically. The height and width of the div can be changed using the block property if the width is not mentioned, then the div under block property will take up the width of the container.

2. <b>Inline:</b> <br/>
   - This property is the default property of anchor tags. This is used to place the div inline i.e. in a horizontal manner. The inline display property ignores the height and the width set by the user.
   

3. <b>Inline-block</b> <br/>
   - This features uses the both properties mentioned above, block and inline. So, this property aligns the div inline but the difference is it can edit the height and the width of block. Basically, this will align the div both in block and inline fashion.

4. <b>None</b> <br/>
   - This property hides the div or the container which use this property.

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
